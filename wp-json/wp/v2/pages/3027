I have always enjoyed working with colleagues in a range of different professional roles. Providing consultative support and supervision was a strong and valued feature of my previous work as a psychiatrist.&nbsp; I bring this experience to my role as a supervisor, focusing on creating the conditions for the development of reflective, ethical practice in which counsellors and psychotherapists can enjoy developing a way of working, and being, that is congruent with their experience, beliefs and values.<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>The style of supervision I provide is underpinned by my commitment to humanistic and person-centred values and principles.&nbsp; As such, I am interested in the person of the therapist as well as their work and therapeutic process with clients. By also paying particular attention to the nature and quality of the relationship, I hope that supervisees can feel confident and safe enough to bring all aspects of themselves and their work, in the spirit of learning, growing and becoming the best therapist they can be.<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>Given my previous work within mental health settings, I have in-depth knowledge of psychiatric diagnosis, psychiatric drugs and the range of professional roles and treatments within NHS mental health services.&nbsp; It also means that I have experience working with people experiencing complex and severe mental disturbance and distress. I am very happy to draw on this experience and knowledge in supporting supervisees. Having said that, I am a strong advocate of non-medicalised approaches and I am particularly interested in the social, environmental and cultural context in which disturbance and distress arises.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>I therefore have a good understanding of the kinds of tensions, challenges and ethical dilemmas that counsellors and psychotherapists may encounter when working from a therapy model that is not aligned with the more mainstream medicalised narratives within Western cultures.<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>I provide supervision either face to face in Gloucester or on-line. My fee for a 1 hour session is \u00a360.&nbsp; I am also happy to provide one-off consultation sessions for the same fee.<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>Please contact me for any further information.<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-8cd03fc elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"8cd03fc\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-1eec4e5\" data-id=\"1eec4e5\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-c925084 elementor-widget elementor-widget-button\" data-id=\"c925084\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"button.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-button-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<a class=\"elementor-button elementor-button-link elementor-size-sm\" href=\"https:\/\/rachelfreeth.com\/contact\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-button-content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-button-text\">Contact me<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am delighted to be offering supervision in addition to my work as a therapist.
